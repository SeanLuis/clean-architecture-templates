# Advanced Laravel Project Setup with Clean Architecture

This document outlines a comprehensive setup process for creating a Laravel project that adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, tailored for large-scale and professional applications.

## Project Structure Overview

The proposed structure is designed to clearly separate concerns by organizing the project into logical divisions that promote maintainability, scalability, and adherence to Clean Architecture principles:

## Detailed Description

### Domain Layer

Contains all the core business logic encapsulated within domain entities, services, and interfaces for repositories. It represents the business rules and is the least likely to change when something external changes.

### Application Layer

Handles the data flow between the domain and the external agents such as the database or the web. It includes use cases which execute specific business rules and application services which orchestrate the execution of domain logic.

### Infrastructure Layer

Implements the interfaces defined in the domain layer with technologies specific to the external agents, like databases or messaging systems. It's where the implementation details live.

### Presentation Layer

Responsible for presenting information to the user and interpreting user commands. This layer includes controllers, views, and other mechanisms by which the user interacts with the system.

### Shared Layer

Contains components that are used across the application, like event bus handling and utilities, ensuring that common functionalities are abstracted and reusable.

## Setup and Configuration

1. Install Laravel and required packages via Composer.
2. Set up the environment and service configurations in the `config/` directory.
3. Develop features following the outlined architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability.
4. Use artisan commands to manage database migrations, queue jobs, and start development servers.

## Running the Script

To run the script, save it as `laravel-cli.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x laravel-cli.sh`, and execute it in the terminal. Follow the on-screen prompts to name your project and let the script handle the rest.

This guide and structure are designed to kickstart the development of robust, scalable Laravel applications, focusing on best practices for scalability, maintainability, and stability.
