# Express.js Project Setup with Clean Architecture

This document outlines a comprehensive setup process for creating an Express.js project that adheres to the principles of Clean Architecture, tailored for large-scale and professional applications.

## Project Structure Overview

The proposed structure is designed to clearly separate concerns by organizing the project into logical divisions that promote maintainability, scalability, and adherence to Clean Architecture principles:

```plaintext
src/
├── core/
│   ├── domain/
│   │   ├── models/                 # Domain models or entities
│   │   │   ├── [Model].js          # Domain model definition
│   │   ├── services/               # Business logic and domain services
│   │   │   ├── [Service].js        # Service implementation
│   │   └── interfaces/             # Interfaces for repository patterns
│   │       ├── [Repository].js     # Repository interface
├── application/
│   ├── useCases/                   # Application use cases or operations
│   │   ├── [UseCase].js            # Use case implementation
│   ├── middleware/                 # Middleware for common tasks (authentication, logging, etc.)
│   │   ├── [Middleware].js         # Middleware implementation
│   ├── validators/                 # Request data validation
│   │   ├── [Validator].js          # Validator implementation
├── infrastructure/
│   ├── database/                   # Database connections and models
│   │   ├── [DatabaseAdapter].js   # Database adapter
│   ├── repositories/               # Implementations of repository interfaces
│   │   ├── [RepositoryImpl].js    # Repository implementation
│   ├── web/                       # Web server and routes
│   │   ├── server.js              # Express server setup
│   │   ├── routes.js              # Route definitions
│   └── utils/                     # Utilities and helpers
│       ├── [Utility].js           # Utility implementation

## Detailed Description

### Core Layer

This layer includes all the core business logic encapsulated within domain entities, services, and interfaces for repositories. It represents the business rules and is the least likely to change when something external changes.

### Application Layer

Handles the data flow between the core layer and the external interfaces such as web servers. It includes use cases which execute specific business rules, middleware for handling requests, and validators.

### Infrastructure Layer

Implements the interfaces defined in the core layer with technologies specific to the external agents, such as databases and web frameworks. It contains the actual server setup, route management, and database connections.

### Config Layer

Contains all configuration settings for the application, ensuring that setup variables are separated from business logic.

## Setup and Configuration

1. Install Express.js and required packages via npm.
2. Set up the environment and service configurations in the `config/` directory.
3. Develop features following the outlined architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability.
4. Start the server and test endpoints to ensure functionality.

## Running the Script

To run the script, save it as `express-cli.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x express-cli.sh`, and execute it in the terminal. Follow the on-screen prompts to name your project and let the script handle the rest.

This guide and structure are designed to kickstart the development of robust, scalable Express.js applications, focusing on best practices for scalability, maintainability, and stability.
