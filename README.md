# General Project Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive project documentation index. This document serves as a central hub linking to detailed documentation for both frontend and backend parts of our projects. Our commitment to best practices like Clean Architecture ensures scalability, maintainability, and ease of testing across all our codebases.

## Clean Architecture

Clean Architecture is a set of practices designed to produce software that is:

- **Robust**: The system operates under different circumstances.
- **Flexible**: It can accommodate new requirements and changes in the tech environment.
- **Maintainable**: The system is easy to understand and modifiable by developers.
- **Testable**: It has clear boundaries for testing core business logic without external elements.

### Frontend Clean Architecture

Frontend applications benefit from Clean Architecture by having a separation of concerns which makes them more modular and maintainable. UI frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and Svelte are used to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces, while keeping the business logic decoupled from UI components.

### Backend Clean Architecture

In the backend, Clean Architecture allows for an agile development environment that can adapt to changes quickly and efficiently. Technologies such as Spring Boot, Express.js, NestJS, and Laravel offer robust solutions for building server-side applications with clear domain models and business logic.
